# Langchain_AI_Assistant
------------------------------
## Project Description  
Langchain_AI_Assistant is a flexible notebook-based AI assistant built with LangChain, enabling retrieval, prompt chaining and smart responses. Ideal for prototyping conversational agents or task-oriented bots, it lets you rapidly integrate LLMs, vector databases and custom logic into a notebook workflow.

---

## Overview  
This project demonstrates how to build an AI assistant using the LangChain framework inside a Jupyter notebook. It combines language model capabilities, retrieval (e.g., vector stores), and prompt engineering in a modular way so you can customise behaviour, chain prompts, and extend logic.

---

## Features  
- Notebook-based workflow for rapid experimentation.  
- Integration with one or more LLMs (open model or API-based).  
- Retrieval-augmented generation: use vector databases or embedding stores.  
- Prompt‐chaining: sequence multiple prompts or logic to achieve complex tasks.  
- Custom logic hooks: extend with your own task handlers or toolkits.  
- Designed for prototyping conversational agents, Q&A tools, or automated assistants.
